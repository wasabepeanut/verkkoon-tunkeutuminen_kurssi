# 1) Tarkastele käytössäsi olevia RFID tuotteita, mieti miten hyvin olet suojautunut RFID urkinnalta?
Some products/items that make use of RFID that I own are e.g. passport, HSL transportation card, library card and smartphone (Wikipedia 25.2.2025), that mostly work with NFC which is a form of RFID technology (Di Leo 27.11.2023).
When we think about the overall safety of these products, they are not that well protected since they are easily scannable and exploitable if you manage to get your hands on one. Although they are easily exploitable, the information you might get from exploiting them might not be as expected or useful.
Out of these items, smartphone would be the most valuable since it has a payment tool that uses NFC technology. An exploiter could get access to my payment card information by cloning it or physically stealing my phone. Both of these methods or pretty hard to execute in real life, since cloning requires the victim to use the phone very close to the cloning device for the NFC technology to be exploited (Stokes 24.2.2023). 

Overall I think the safety of my RFID products are not that secured (excluding my phone) since they do not have any actual security measures such as passwords.
