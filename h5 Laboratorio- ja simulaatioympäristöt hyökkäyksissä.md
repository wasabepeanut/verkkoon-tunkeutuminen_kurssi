# Mininet
To complete the upcoming tasks, I will have to install Mininet VM.

I followed the instructions on the [official Mininet website](https://mininet.org/download/#option-1-mininet-vm-installation-easy-recommended).

First I downloaded the [VM Image](https://github.com/mininet/mininet/releases/download/2.3.0/mininet-2.3.0-210211-ubuntu-20.04.1-legacy-server-amd64-ovf.zip).

Secondly I had to download a virtualization system. As I already had Oracle Virtualbox, I skipped this part.

After my VM Image was downloaded, I extracted the content and then double-clicked on the ovf file. This took me straight to Oracle VirtualBox and after that I imported the file with default settings.

Now I have installed a Mininet VM. I will test to see if it works.
