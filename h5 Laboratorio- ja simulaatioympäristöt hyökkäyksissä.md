# a) Evilginx
## Installation

For this task I will install the tool Evilginx following the [instructions](https://help.evilginx.com/pro/installation/local).

To make Evilginx work we will first need to install the tools Golang and nvm.

**Golang**

First I downloaded the [file](https://go.dev/dl/).

    rm -rf /usr/local/go && tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.24.2.linux-amd64.tar.gz

Adding /usr/local/go/bin to the PATH environment variable.

    export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin

And lastly checking to see if the system has Golang now

    go version

Building the Evilginx binary with the "make" command.

    make

At first it did not seem to work. I tried asking ChatGPT for assistance and according to it, I have to first be in the Evilginx project directory before giving the command.

With ChatGPT I also cloned the evilginx github repository to my home directory and committed the make command.

    git clone https://github.com/kgretzky/evilginx2.git
    cd evilginx2
    make

This seemed to work. According to the instructions, the built binary should be under build/.
This is what I found in the folder

After building evilginx, I proceeded to run the tool normally:

    sudo ./build/evilginx

## In action

Now I will proceed to simulate an phishing attack with the tool following the steps from a [guide](https://nateahess.medium.com/evilginx-quickstart-guide-b4124e8dc8f3).

First I will install [phislets](https://github.com/An0nUD4Y/Evilginx2-Phishlets), which are small config files used to configure Evilginx for attacks (Nate 6.12.2024).

    git clone https://github.com/An0nUD4Y/Evilginx2-Phishlets

Moving the phislets to the right directory:

    cp -r Evilginx2-Phislets/* /home/duyp/evilginx/phislets/

Checking the contents:

    ls -l /home/duyp/evilginx/phislets/

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e736595a-2175-4a5a-8617-5503a529251c)

Seems right.
Now that I have the phislets, I can run the tool again with the phislets

    sudo ./build/evilginx -p ./phislets/

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5dc56743-5024-4d39-a7cf-bd64cd07366c)

This is what the output looked like.
I noticed that some links could be clicked so I tried following the link "www.amazon.com".

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f4685ac4-ef40-49e8-95f3-f869ea7a024a)

This took me to Amazon (pretty obvious from the name).
This site is the official website for Amazon, except it has been "tampered" with Evilginx. Evilginx acts as a "Adversary in the Middle" that serves as a legitimate page for malicious acts (Nichols 8.14.2024).

Now I will try to configure a fake domain for phishing.

First I created a HTML file.

# Mininet

I followed the instructions on the [official Mininet website](https://mininet.org/download/#option-1-mininet-vm-installation-easy-recommended) to install Mininet on Oracle Virtualbox.

First I downloaded the [VM Image](https://github.com/mininet/mininet/releases/download/2.3.0/mininet-2.3.0-210211-ubuntu-20.04.1-legacy-server-amd64-ovf.zip).

Secondly I had to download a virtualization system. As I already had Oracle Virtualbox, I skipped this part.

After my VM Image was downloaded, I extracted the content and then double-clicked on the ovf file. This took me straight to Oracle VirtualBox and after that I imported the file with default settings.

Now I have installed a Mininet VM. I will test to see if it works.

Seems to work fine.
