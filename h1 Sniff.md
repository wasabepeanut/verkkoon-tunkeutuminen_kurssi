# x) Wireshark
- One of the most popular tools used for network "sniffing" and analyzing (Karvinen 28.3.2025).
- Sniffing = monitoring network traffic for information (source, destination, protocols, etc.) (PagerDuty 2025).
- How to use:
  - Install the tool to your OS, such as Debian
  - Add the group of people to allow sniffing, and then update by logging back in
  - Choose the target network interfaces for sniffing. (Karvinen 28.3.2025)

# x) Network Interface Names
- Network interface = a "network card", but not necessarily physical.
- Interface types are determined by the start of the name called a "prefix".
- Prefix examples:
  - en = Wired Ethernet
  - wl = WLAN, WiFi
  - lo = Loopback adapter.
- Numbers after a prefix identify the device or the location where the computer is connected to. (Karvinen 28.3.2025)
