# a) Tutustu wifi challenge lab 2.1 harjoitus ympäristöön ja käytä tarvittaessa hyväksesi jo olemassa olevia ohjeita

In this exercise I will be familiarizing myself with the Wifi Challenge Lab 2.1. 


## Prerequisites

For starters, I went to the [WifiChallenge website](https://lab.wifichallenge.com/) and created an account for myself.

After logging in, I went to the README tab.

It says there that sharing solutions or detailed explanations is prohibited, so I will not be explaining too much from my experience in the Lab exercises.

I proceeded to download the folder for VirtualBox from the [Proton Drive link](https://drive.proton.me/urls/Q4WPB23W7R#Qk4nxMH8Q4oQ) (since I am using VBox).

We are in!

I completed four challenges in the lab with the help of the [walkthrough](https://r4ulcl.com/posts/walkthrough-wifichallenge-lab-2.0/#01-what-is-the-channel-that-the-wifi-global-access-point-ap-is-currently-using).

# b) Kirjoita raportti siitä mitä opit ja mitkä asia yllättivät sinut kun tutustuit harjoitukseen.

What did I learn from doing these practices and material?

I do think that I learned a little more about capturing and monitoring traffic and how to analyze and identify the information I get from monitoring traffic. The exercises I completed in the lab were really interesting and quite hard to fully understand. 
There were also many complex commands with parameters that were used, which were also new to me.

Doing these exercises also helped me see the network security from an attacker's point of view, and how they would try to execute malicious activities on networks.

I also learned that even when following a walkthrough step by step, you might still encounter some difficulties, which might are not necessarily a bad thing since you can learn from them.

With enough knowledge and experience in this field, you can do many things, considering a beginner like me could also do some sort of "hacking", just by following some instructions.

Acting as an attacker and trying to infiltrate to networks (non-legally :)) is a vital part in building a resilient defense, these kinds of exercises as an example.


# c) Miten suhtautumisesi WLanin turvallisuuteen muuttui sen jälkeen kun teit harjoitukset?

I have always been wary of the safety of WLANs, which is why I usually prevent from connecting to WLANs that I do not trust. After these exercises, I still relate to WLANs the same way or maybe even stricter than before. 
Seeing how "easy" it is for attackers to manipulate and infiltrate into networks has made me even more cautious about connecting to untrusted networks.

In most cases though WLANs are pretty secure and nothing usually happens, atleast in the private ones.
